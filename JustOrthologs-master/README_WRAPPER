JustOrthologs Wrapper

##########################

This wrapper is provided as a courtesy, and may or may not be the fastest or most memory efficient way to extract 
all CDS regions from 2 gff3 and 2 fasta files. Multithreading is only used for justOrthologs,
and large fasta files are read into memory for the extracting phase. Typical runtime to extract CDS regions from a 
complete genome is under an hour, but it may run longer depending on the size of the genome/gff3 file and the 
processing capabilities of the machine you are running.

##########################

ARGUMENT OPTIONS:

The wrapper has the following options:
 -h, --help    show this help message and exit
 -g1 GFF3_ONE  1st GFF3 (gzip allowed with .gz)
 -g2 GFF3_TWO  2nd GFF3 fasta file (gzip allowed with .gz)
 -r1 REF_ONE   1st Reference Genome (gzip allowed with .gz)
 -r2 REF_TWO   2nd Reference Genome (gzip allowed with .gz)
 -fa1 FASTA1   1st Fasta file (only used without --e)
 -fa2 FASTA2   2nd Fasta file (only used without --e)
 -e            Extract CDS regions from genomes
 -r            Run JustOrthologs
 -f            Filters genes based on annotations
 -s            Sort FASTA file for running JustOrthologs
 -k            Keep All Temporary Files
 -d            For Distantly Related Species (only with --r)
 -c            Combine Both Algorithms In JustOrthologs For Best Accuracy
 -o OUTPUT     Output File for --r
 -t THREADS    Number of Cores (only affects -r option)
 -all          Run --e, --f, --s, and --r
##########################

REQUIREMENTS:

If you are using MacOS, make sure that gsed is installed:
    brew install gnu-sed


wrapper.py uses Python version 2.7

Python libraries that must be installed include:
1. sys
2. os
3. multiprocessing
4. argparse
5. gzip
6. biopython

If any of those libraries is not currently in your Python Path, use the following command:
pip install --user [library_name]
to install the library in your path.

The wrapper needs to be used in the same directory as 
getNoException.py, justOrthologs.py, revised_gff3_parser.py, and sortFastaBySeqLen.sh

##########################

Input Files:

There are many ways to run this program, and the wrapper will tell you where your output files are created.
Descriptions of what the algorithms can do are in the argument options.

Typical usage requires 2 fasta files that may or may not be gzipped, and 2 gff3 files that may or may not be gzipped.

##########################

USAGE:

The default number of threads is 16. If you want to change that, use the -t option.
However, the -t option will only affect justOrthologs.py

Example of typical usage:

python wrapper.py -g1 smallTest/wrapperTest/small_pan.gff3 -g2 smallTest/wrapperTest/small_human.gff3 -r1 smallTest/wrapperTest/small_pan.fasta.gz -r2 smallTest/wrapperTest/small_human.fasta.gz -all -o output

Running the above command will produce a single output file called output in the current directory.
Temporary files are created and removed, so don't worry if you see other files before the job is complete.
Running the above command takes about 13 seconds of real time and less than 1 minute of user time on our hardware.

Thank you, and happy researching!!
